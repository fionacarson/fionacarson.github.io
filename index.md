### Incidence of Cancer in NHS Borders
[Incidence of Cancer in NHS Borders - Markdown Report](/html_files/cancer_incidence_data_investigation.html)

The incidence of cancer in NHS Borders was investigated to help inform planning for the future provision of cancer treatment services (mock task). Datasets from Public Health Scotland were cleaned, wrangled and analysed. This was conducted using R with the tidyverse package. Results of the analysis were presented to key stakeholders.

Key Findings
- The population of the Borders region of Scotland is rising.
- The number of incidences of cancer in NHS Borders is also rising but at a faster rate than can be accounted for by the population increase.
- Bladder, prostrate, lung and breast cancer account of 60% of all incidences.
- A pronounced spike in the number of cancer diagnoses is observed every 3 years. Upon further analysis this spike was found to come from the breast cancer data and research indicates GP practices only take part in screening programmes every 3 years.
- 11 out of 12 of the most common cancer types have increasing numbers of incidences (only leukaemias are not increasing).

### Dirty Data Project
This project involves cleaning "dirty" datasets and performing analysis on the cleaned data. The main purpose is to gain experience in dealing with such datasets. The outputs of each task are a cleaning script, a cleaned dataset and a markdown document containing the results of the analysis. It should be noted that this analysis was conducted durinng week 4 of the CodeClan Data Analysis course and so the coding is at a somewhat basic level.

The work in this repository was conducted with the R programming language.

The boing boing candy dataset contains the results of a Halloween candy survey. The data covers three years (2015, 2016 and 2017) and includes information on the person completing the survey, such as age, gender and country. The ratings used were Joy, Despair, Meh or NA for the 2016 and 2017 data; Meh was not an option in 2015. The 2015 data also lacked information on the gender and country of the person completing the survey. I believe it is accurate to say the original datasets were a mess and required extensive cleaning. The country column, in particular, had a lot of non-standard answers. Some analysis was conducted on the age of participants but most of the analysis focussed on which candies were most or least popular. The items rated weren't just candy, things like DVDs, glow sticks and pharmaceuticals were also included. Limiting the analysis to just candy was considered but it was decided to leave non-candy items in for completeness.




#### Decathlon

[Decathlon - Markdown Report](/html_files/decathlon_analysis.html)


The decathlon dataset contains the results from each of the 10 events in the decathlon. The data covers two competitions - the 2004 Olympic Games and the 2004 Decastar competition. The data also includes the place the athlete finished ("rank") and their total points. This dataset only required a few relatively minor cleaning steps before it was interrogated to answer questions on longest jump, average 100 metre times, highest points total etc. This is a nice dataset which shows the dominance of three decathletes during the 2004 season.
